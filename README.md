# Exam Timetabling Optimization Using GA & ACO

## 📌 Overview

This project solves the **Exam Timetabling Problem (ETP)** using two metaheuristic algorithms:
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**

The aim is to generate conflict-free and well-optimized exam schedules while respecting both **hard** and **soft** constraints in an academic environment.

## 🧠 Problem Definition

### Hard Constraints:
- No student can attend two exams simultaneously.
- Room capacity must not be exceeded.
- Rooms can't be double-booked.
- Multi-slot exams must use consecutive timeslots.

### Soft Constraints:
- Avoid multiple exams for a student on the same day.
- Even distribution of difficult exams.
- Minimize weekend scheduling.
- Spread exams uniformly across the schedule.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Minimize student conflicts.
- Maximize room and timeslot utilization.
- Distribute exams uniformly.
- Minimize back-to-back exams for students.

## 🧬 Genetic Algorithm (GA)

### Components:
- **Chromosome:** Encodes exam assignments to timeslots and rooms.
- **Fitness Function:** Penalizes violations and rewards well-optimized schedules.
- **Operators:**
  - Tournament selection
  - One-point and two-point crossover
  - Timeslot and room mutation

### Performance:
- **Execution Time:** ~64s
- **Best Fitness Score:** 27.0
- **Convergence:** Steady across generations

## 🐜 Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

### Components:
- **Ants build solutions** using pheromone trails.
- **Probabilistic path selection** based on pheromones and heuristics.
- **Local Search:** Post-construction adjustments to improve quality.

### Performance:
- **Execution Time:** ~3521s
- **Best Fitness Score:** 40
- **Convergence:** Unstable; early peak followed by degradation

## ⚖️ GA vs ACO Comparison

| Metric | GA | ACO | Winner |
|--------|----|-----|--------|
| Execution Time | ✅ 64.13s | ❌ 3521.42s | GA |
| Fitness Score (Lower is Better) | ✅ 27.0 | ❌ 40 | GA |
| Conflict Handling | ✅ 0 Conflicts | ✅ 0 Conflicts | Tie |
| Convergence | ✅ Steady | ❌ Degraded | GA |

**Final Verdict:** GA outperformed ACO in speed, solution quality, and stability.
